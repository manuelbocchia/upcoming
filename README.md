< UPCOMING >

I'm working on an Eventbrite clone. I called it UPCOMING.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, specifically to practice with model queries and associations.

I will make an effort to have a functional website looking palatable at least. I'm planning on using bootstrap for the looks.
